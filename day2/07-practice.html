    <h1>William Blake</h1>
    <h2>&lt;OUR MISSION&gt;</h2>
   <p>
    By all accounts Blake had a <i>pleasant and peaceful</i> childhood, made even more pleasant by skipping <del>any formal schooling</del>. As a young boy he wandered the <em>streets of London</em> and could easily escape to the surrounding countryside. Even at an early age, however, <strong>his unique mental powers</strong> would prove disquieting.

    <h2>&lt;OUR VISION&gt;</h2>
    <p>
        One incident at this time affected Blake deeply. In June of 1780 riots broke out in London incited by the anti-Catholic preaching of Lord George Gordon and by resistance to continued war against the American colonists. <u><strong>Houses, churches, and prisons</strong> were burned by <strong><em>uncontrollable</em></strong> mobs bent on destruction</u>. On one evening, whether by design or by accident, <mark>Blake found himself at the front of the mob that burned Newgate prison</mark>.
